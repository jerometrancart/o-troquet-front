# o-troquet-front
A copy of our front code in React-Redux for the final school project at O'Clock

It was a website on which we could play to 421 game, and spend time with friends, add friends to a friendlist, create room for playing, chatting and keeping score

Front was in react redux, back was using a Symfony API Rest and rooms were generated in socket.io
